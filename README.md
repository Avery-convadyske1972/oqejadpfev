## Operational Dossier: Mission Objective - De-Avocado-tion Protocol

### Synopsis

An unconventional assignment takes the team into the mind of Mr. Silas Henderson, a notoriously difficult client whose singular obsession with avocado toast is causing significant friction within his company's executive brunch meetings. Our mission: plant the subtle, yet revolutionary, idea that other breakfast options exist, thereby restoring corporate harmony (and preventing further delays caused by ingredient sourcing). This requires a multi-layered inception, navigating the surprisingly robust psychological defenses built around Henderson's core avocado-based belief system.

### Team Lead Notes

Cobb: This is... unusual. Lower stakes than usual, but potentially more frustrating. Henderson's subconscious is apparently built like a fortified brunch spot. Arthur, you handle point. Ariadne, the architecture needs to be very convincing, maybe less M.C. Escher, more upscale cafe? Leo, watch the projections, they might be armed with artisanal spreads.

### Personnel

   Cobb: Extraction/Inception Lead
   Arthur: Point Man, Logistics & Kick Specialist (Tolerates avocados, barely)
   Ariadne: Architect (Finds the architectural implications of toast fascinating)
   Leo: Subconscious Security (New recruit, prone to existential crises over condiments)
   Mr. Silas Henderson: The Target (Deeply, deeply committed to the creamy green fruit)

## Operational Layers & Status

### Layer 1: The Corporate Cafeteria (Status: Compromised)

   Objective: Initial seed planting - introduce alternative breakfast words ("cereal," "eggs," "waffles").
   Architecture: Standard, slightly depressing office cafeteria. Beige walls, plastic plants.
   Subconscious Projections: Mostly office workers, milling about, all somehow holding or talking about avocado toast.
   Current Status: Inception attempt failed. Henderson's projection at the counter just kept repeating "Extra avocado, please." Security (a projection of his overly-eager intern) immediately offered us a sample on miniature sourdough. Arthur had to use non-lethal force (gently knocking the tray over). We withdrew to Layer 2.


<!-- Note from Arthur: The sheer volume of toast projections was unnerving. Recommend higher caloric expenditure on next layer. -->


### Layer 2: Henderson's 'Happy Place' - The Farmers Market (Status: Active Engagement)

   Objective: Associate avocado toast with minor, negative inconveniences (e.g., long lines, high prices).
   Architecture: Bright, overly cheerful outdoor market. Smell of fresh produce (mostly avocados).
   Subconscious Projections: Hipster vendors, aggressively cheerful baristas, and security projections disguised as organic food inspectors, specifically checking for... you guessed it.
   Current Status: We're attempting to create a localized 'avocado shortage' within this layer, hoping to trigger mild annoyance in Henderson's projection. Ariadne's trying to collapse a display of organic avocados. Leo almost got apprehended by a projection demanding his "USDA Organic Dream Certification." Arthur is bartering with a projection for a non-avocado-based pastry (failed). The air is thick with the smell. It's becoming difficult to concentrate.


<!-- Note from Ariadne: Found a hidden sub-layer beneath a organic kale stand. Appears to be a shrine to 'Artisanal Toast Spreads'. Proceeding with caution. -->


### Layer 3: The Guacamole Gauntlet (Status: Deep Dive)

   Objective: Directly confront the core belief structure. Plant the 'Sometimes is okay, always is... a bit much?' idea.
   Architecture: Looks like a literal fortress constructed from giant, interlocking avocado halves. Moats filled with what appears to be liquid guacamole. Defenses are projections wielding giant tortilla chips like weapons.
   Subconscious Projections: Smaller, faster projections resembling anthropomorphic avocados. Highly aggressive. Also, projections of various celebrity chefs endorsing avocado toast.
   Current Status: Breach successful. We're currently navigating corridors that smell intensely of garlic and lime. The avocado-projections are surprisingly agile. Arthur is using his briefcase shield to deflect incoming tortilla chips. Leo is having trouble distinguishing between real walls and illusionary spreads. Inception point is believed to be in the 'Pantry of Pits' at the center of the fortress.


<!-- Note from Leo: Is... is that wall made of pure avocado? I can't tell anymore. Everything looks green. Am I a projection? -->


---

## Kick Procedure

   Primary Kick: Simultaneous activation of commercial-grade toaster sound across all layers.
   Secondary Kick (Failsafe): Van sequence (Reality). Van hits designated speed bump on 4th street precisely as "Closing Time" by Semisonic reaches the lyric "open up the next can of worms".


<!-- Note from Arthur: Double-check the playlist, Leo. Last time you put on 'All Star'. -->


---

## Potential Complications & Dependencies

   Projection Overload: Henderson's subconscious is packed with avocado-related entities.
   Aroma Contamination: Lingering smell of avocados reported in higher layers and potentially upon waking. (Bring air freshener).
   Idea Rejection: The concept of not eating avocado toast may be so alien it causes catastrophic subconscious rejection.
   Real-World Dependency: Need confirmation the extraction van driver understands the critical importance of the speed bump timing and the specific song.

## Final Notes

This mission is green-lighted. Remember the objective is subtlety. We're not telling him to hate avocado toast, just to consider the possibility of other options. And for the love of all that is holy, try not to taste the guacamole moat.
